    <p>• Mount Fuji is Japan's tallest peak, 3,776m (12,388 ft). 
      <br>• It last erupted in 1707-1708.
      <br>• It is easiest to see in winter due to the cold, dry, and clear air. The mountain's snow capped peak stands out, making winter a popular time to view the scenery. Unlike summer, when clouds and humidity often hide it, winter offers the most reliable views.
      <br>• It is considered one of Japan's 3 sacred mountains (Mount Fuji, Hakusan, and Tateyama).
