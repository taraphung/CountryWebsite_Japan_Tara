    <p>╰┈➤ Samurai were Japan's aristocratic, highly disciplined warrior class, serving daimyos (feudal lords) from the 10th century until the 19th century. They were famous for their martial skills, armor, and swords (especially katanas).
      <br>╰┈➤ Samurai and Shoguns were in the warrior class and established feudal systems.
      <br>╰┈➤ There was a strict ethical code called Bushido (the way of the warrior) that emphasized loyalty, honor, and self-discipline.
      <br>╰┈➤ Japan was influenced by the Chinese and Korean. Early adoption of writing, Buddhism, government structures, and art where from them.
      <br>╰┈➤ The Meiji Restoration (1868) overthrew the feudal Tokugawa shogunate and restored power to the emperor, leading to modernization and westernization. It was important because it transformed Japan from an isolated, feudal state into a modern industrial and military power, allowing it to compete with Western nations and avoid colonization.
